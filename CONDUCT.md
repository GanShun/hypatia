# The Hypatia Hypervisor Community Code of Conduct

## Conduct

**Contact**: [hypatia-conduct@groups.io](mailto:hypatia-conduct@groups.io)

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment
  for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body
  size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, veteran status, or
  other similar characteristic.
- In communicatons, please avoid using offensive nicknames or other
  identifiers or language that might detract from a friendly, safe, and
  welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous.  There is no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.  There is
  seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum.  If you have solid ideas
  you want to experiment, make a fork and see how it goes.
- We will exclude you from interaction with the rest of the community if
  you insult, demean or harass anyone.  That is not welcome behavior.  We
  interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the
  [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you lack
  clarity about what might be included in this concept, please read that
  definition.  In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes
  people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable.  No matter who you are, if you
  feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a
  community member, please contact someone from the Hypatia moderation
  team immediately.  Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer,
  we care about making this community a safe, friendly place for you and
  want all to feel welcome.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other similar
  behavior is unwelcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.
If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the Hypatia team.

1. Remarks that violate the Hypatia community standards of conduct, including
   hateful, hurtful, oppressive, violent, or exclusionary remarks, are not
   allowed.  Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and
   never in a hateful manner (though perhaps consider whether you might be
   able to get your point across in another way).
1. Remember that typed words have long life-times and what you write may
   reflect back on you later.  Always strive to be polite, courteous and
   professional.
1. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate and are listed in the code
   of conduct are not allowed.
1. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
1. If the warning is ignored, the user will be asked to step away from
   the communications medium to allow tensions to ease.
1. If such users come back and continue to engage in similar behavior they
   will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
1. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was
   a first offense and the the injured party is offered a genuine apology.
1. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please
   take it up with that moderator or with a different moderator, but please
   do so in private.  Inline complaints about moderator action are
   discouraged: it is a tough job and moderators are asked to defuse complex,
   charged interactions.  Criticism in the moment can make the situation
   that much more difficult.
1. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members.
   If moderators create inappropriate situations, they should expect less
   leeway than others.

In the Hypatia community we strive to go the extra step looking out for
each other.  Do not just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to
be your best self.  In particular, avoid engaging with offensive or
sensitive off-topic issues; this too often leads to unnecessary fights,
hurt feelings, and damaged trust.  Worse, it can drive people away from
the community entirely.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge
to be defensive.  Just stop doing what it was they complained about and
apologize.  Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused,
please try to make your fellow community members feel comfortable.
Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because
we want to talk about cool technology.  You will find that people will be
eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Hypatia venues
including but not limited to mailing list, bug reports, code repositories,
and real-time communications mechanisms.

If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider
explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your
own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
